The samples come from a subset of the 1987 National Indonesia Contraceptive Prevalence Survey and they contain married women who were either not pregnant or do not know if they were at the time of interview.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has 1473 instances with 10 features including the class. Information of the features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Wife's age (16-49): numerical\n",
    "* Wife's education (categorical) 1=low, 2, 3, 4=high\n",
    "* Husband's education (categorical) 1=low, 2, 3, 4=high\n",
    "* Number of children ever born (0-16): numerical\n",
    "* Wife's religion (binary) 0=Non-Islam, 1=Islam\n",
    "* Wife's now working? (binary) 0=Yes, 1=No\n",

    "In this case, the categorical features are set as nominal, but if we observe there are some that may seem as ordinal because they use a low to high scale. For that reason, one of the aims is to treat those features as ordinal and the other is to treat it as nominal. After doing this, the performance will be evaluated to assess which option is the best. There are also no Nan values in the dataset.\n",

    "As we can see above the classes are a bit unbalanced, because class 1 is 42.7% of the dataset, while class 2 is 34.69% and class 3 is 22.60%. So even if they don't have the same number of samples, they are still close to each other."

On the other hand, if we only use recall, the model may misclassify some classes, which would generate false conclusions and ultimately affect the interpretation of how women choose their contraceptive method. Therefore, in this case, the performance measure will be the F1-score because it is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, which means that we will consider both measures. \n",

    "The decision tree has better results for class 1 because there were more instances in comparison to the others. However, there are 50 instances that are being classified as false positives since they belonged to class 3. Moreover, class 2 has lower true positives, which means that the model struggles to identify the women who use long-term contraceptives. In this case, the model also has more false positives than class 3. This suggests that the model is producing several false positives that belonged to class 3. Moreover, most of the instances for class 3 were correctly classified, although there are some exceptions. In general, the decision tree performs better for class one."

    "This classifier is commonly seen as a simple algorithm because it only need two parameters to actually work, k-values and distance. It is also, called a lazy algorithm because it stores the dataset and at the time of classification is performs an action (it doesn't learn immeditatly). There are several statistical methods to choose the k value, such as: cross-validation (finds best value of k bu using k-folds), elbow method, odd values. Moreover, the metric of distances that can be used are: euclidean distance (straigh line distance), Manhattan distance (total distance it takes to travel by moving horizontally and vertically) and Minkowski that is able to represent either Euclidian (2) or Manhattan (1)depending on the value of p. After selecting this two measures, the algorithm uses a voting technique, to classify a data point into a category (GeeksforGeeks, 2025)."

    "Since KNN is a classifier that uses distance as one of it's parameters, it will be nessecary to scale the numeric features, because otherwise the model will be biased towards the ones that have heigher values, which in this case correspond to the feature of wife's age. Moreover, the categorical variables will be treated as they were stated before, so that the results between models use the same criteria. Moreover, in this case the dataset doesn't have any NaN values, so the only preprocessing will be done as before. It is also important to mention, that to avoid loosing information from the original dataset, the binary features will be set as passthrough inside the pipline, because there will be no change to those variables, since they are already in zeros and ones. This will allow the model to give a certain importance to the instances depending on the order that they have. \n"

    "The confusion matrix helps to visualize how well instances are classified, allowing us to understand the model's performance. In that regard, we can see how class one had the best results since 85 instances were classified correctly as women who don't use contraceptives. In contrast, class 2 (long-term) failed to effectively classify women's choices, as a there were some instances that were incorrectly assigned to this class when they belonged to class 3. Hence, the model doesn't perform well for class 2. Finally, class three had 57 true positive values. Therefore, the model performs best when it classifies the class one. However, it is also important to understand if there was underfitting in the model because the number of k-values was 37 (when the k-value is very high, it tends to underfit)."

    "In the case of this dataset, KNeighborsClassifier is a suitable classifier because it can handle well-preprocessed mixed instances, including numerical, binary and nominal. Another thing to note is that KNN tends to behave adequately for relatively small datasets, and it specialises in multiclass classification, which is the case in this project (only 1473 instances). Since KNeighborsClassifier looks for the minimum distance, it tends to perform well when it classifies the targets based on their features, which, in this case, will allow us to understand more about the characteristics that women have based on their contraceptive choices. However, we noticed that there are a total of 626 women who don't use contraceptive methods, while there are 333 who use them for the long term, which might cause the model to underperform in some classes. Thus, to make all classes more representative of the dataset, we implemented both StratifiedKfolds and RepeatedStratifiedKfolds so that the minority class could be treated with more weight.  That is also the reason why we preferred to use a weighted F1 score and because it allows us to ensure that the women's contraceptive choice is correctly classified. As stated before, accuracy is not a recommended measure because the data is a bit unbalanced. Moreover, using precision would mean we ignore false negatives, which is important because missing a woman who uses contraceptives could lead to misinformed conclusions. Similarly, relying only on recall might overpredict a class, thus it would be misclassifying their choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "To set the range of k values, it was necessary to try several ranges and observe which one got the best F1 score overall. Initially, the range went from 1-20, where the best result for StratifiedKFold was of 0.57 (with 13 k-values) and the best one for RepeatedStratifiedKFold was 0.55 with 18 k-values. We then increased the interval to 1-30, where the best result for StratifiedKFold was of 0.56 (with 13-k values) and the one of RepeatedStratifiedKFold was of 0.55 with 18 k-values. Then, the range was changed to 1-40, and the results improved by getting a 0.58 F1 score with 37 values, which helps to smooth the results. If we incremented the number of k neighbours, the result was always the same, so we decided to stay within the range of 1-40. To find the metric of distance, we used GridSearch, tried all of the possible metrics and chose the one that gave the highest weighted F1 score. To perform cross-validation, we took into account the fact that the data is not perfectly balanced, and we decided to try both StratifiedKFold and RepeatedStratifiedKFold. The values of the number of splits were changed several times for both of them until we got the best result, which was 10 with RepeatedStratifiedKFold. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The best model for KNN has an F1 score of 0.58, while the score of the training set was 0.55. Therefore, the model didn't overfit, nor did it underfit, given that the results of the test and training were reason similar. Although, it is important to note that the test score was slighlty heigher than the train score, which is a consequence of the small dataset. Moreover, even if we changed the hyperparameters, the results were still lower than 0.58. This is mainly because there were not enough features, and the dataset was small. Therefore, the model didn't have enough information to learn from, causing it to have low results. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, if we observe the results of class 1 (no-use), we can see that it was the class that was best classified. Hence it had higher scores for all performance measures. This has to do with the fact that it represented the class with the most frequent occurrences in the original dataset. It is also possible to observe that class 3 (short-term) had 55% of the F1 score, while class 2 (long-term) had 50%, which suggests that the model struggled the most when it tried to classify class 2. However, the fact that class one (no-use), was the one that is best classified suggests that it is possible to find some insights about the characteristics of the women that were classified in this class, which would help to understand the reason why some women in India are opting against the use of contraceptive methods."
